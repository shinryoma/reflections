With Google Docs, you always have somewhat recent backup. But backup isn't logical versioning. 

Manually saving allows versioning when it makes sense.

18.Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because in programs, files are related to each and changes in one file causes a changes in others or how they appear. 

Google Docs is an productivity suite that is not designed for projects. 

22. How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log to show the commit log
q to quit

git diff first second
to show the difference between two files. 

26. How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

if it doesn't work out, you can go back to a previously working version.

31. Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Senior project.
